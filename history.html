    <h3 class="year">2014</h3>
    <p class="year-2014">
      <img src="images/firewood.jpg" class="paragraph-image" />
      In the fall of 2014, Easy Eddy's was conceived as a simple firewood
      business. I would cut fallen trees on people's properties in the Rockford
      and Loves Park area for no charge, then I would split the wood by hand
      with a maul and sell it by the facecord. That was a great year for selling
      firewood in Rockford because the price of natural gas had gone up
      dramatically at the beginning of winter.
    </p>
    <h3 class="year">2015-2016</h3>
    <p class="year-2015">
      <img src="images/machining.jpg" class="machining" />
      Over the next three years, I continued to sell firewood and began charging
      a small fee for tree removals. During this time I was working a regular
      job in machining, but I married my wife Taylor and had a continued need
      for additional income. Cutting trees down became a great passion of mine
      as I gradually accumulated the equipment and experience necessary to apply
      more skilled techniques to the falling process.
    </p>

      <p class="year-2017-paragraph">
        In 2017 I purchased my first F-150, and began doing full tree removals
        in Rockford and surrounding areas including Cherry Valley, Machesney
        Park, Roscoe, Caledonia, and even Beloit. In the fall of that year I
        finally quit my full time job and struck out with full dedication to my
        own business, which I licensed as Easy Eddy's Trees. I purchased a
        million dollars of liability insurance and continued to provide
        affordable pricing at every quote. Throughout the first warm season in
        2018, my business relied upon landscaping and lawn care to bolster
        sales, but the tree business had captured my heart.

      <p class="year-2018-paragraph">
        Keeping the truck and equipment in excellent mechanical repair was a
        high priority for me then as it continues to be today. This focus
        resulted in my developing a superior understanding of truck and engine
        service, and I have made most repairs on my growing fleet with my own
        tools. Paying mechanics to fix my trucks proved to be a waste of company
        money as well as causing loss of earnings due to extended wait periods
        for service. Each successive mechanical failure has resulted in personal
        skill development and the growth of a well supplied workshop. I
        purchased an old F-450 diesel flatbed truck from a landscaper near
        Poplar grove late in 2018, and was able to relieve my F-150 from many of
        its extreme duties.... That was one of the best purchases I ever made
        for Easy Eddy's Trees. The F-150 was not well suited for this kind of
        heavy load carrying, but I continued to use it with a custom wooden
        truck bed that I built myself.

      <p class="year-2019-paragraph">
        Within six months from that time, the frame on my half-ton pickup was
        broken in half from overloading, and I purchased a more suitable truck
        for this work, a Ram 3500. In that same period of time, I purchased a
        Bandit 1290 drum-fed brush chipper and hired an employee to drive the
        second truck. I had become engaged in more technical jobs and was
        forming a clearer understanding of safe climbing, rigging, and removals.
        At that time we were moving and loading all wood and limbs by hand with
        no machinery to assist.

      <p class="year-2020-paragraph">
        Our need for a dump truck was met by an old Chevy K3500 which was for
        sale by another tree company. Up until we purchased that truck, we
        unloaded every chunk of wood by hand and every bit of wood chips with
        grain shovels. You can imagine the intensity of the labor that was done
        on a daily basis. In 2020, there was a huge boost in the number of tree
        service customers. We continued to develop our skill set and make
        connections in tree care throughout the Rockford region. The big block
        Chevy had a castastrophic drivetrain failure, so I had the dump bed and
        hydraulic system installed onto my flatbed F-450. That fall, Easy Eddy's
        purchased a dump trailer to haul and dump wood. This was a great
        improvement to efficiency and increased our capacity to remove large
        trees.

      <p>
        Spring of 2021 was the beginning of a new era as I purchased the Bobcat
        MT100 mini track loader! These became very exciting times for the
        business. Now, instead of suffering countless hours of laborious
        lifting, cutting, throwing, and wheelbarrow pushing, we were able to let
        a machine handle the heavy work for us! Large trees have become much
        less of a challenge with the aid of this priceless piece of machinery,
        which fits through a standard 36-inch gate and is rated to lift and
        carry 1000 lbs! I also purchased a stump grinder attachment for the
        Bobcat, sufficient to handle most small and medium stump removal jobs.

      <p class="year-2021-2-paragraph">
        There were some serious setbacks in 2021, including the engine failure
        of our Bandit 1290 chipper. I was forced to purchase another chipper,
        which is a much safer Morbark M12R that has hydraulic feed rollers and
        an emergency reverse bar to keep my workers safe during operation. We
        are now able to feed the wood chipper with the Bobcat, which provides an
        additional boost in efficiency for tree removals and trimming.
        Throughout the time that I have been operating as Easy Eddy's Tree
        Service, I have continued to develop and grow as a tree climber. I have
        learned to assess trees for certain diseases or conditions that are
        common to the Northern Illinois region, as well as how to properly prune
        trees for human safety, local codes, aesthetics, overall health, and
        longevity.

        Easy Eddy's Tree Service is equipped to handle jobs that require complex
        rigging and even integration with crane service if it is necessary. I
        gained my certification as an arborist with the International Society of
        Arboriculture this year and am continuing to pursue additional education
        to further my knowledge of tree health, rigging methods, industry
        approved practices, and safety measures. This company has a lot to offer
        our customers and we strive for excellence every day. Call us at
