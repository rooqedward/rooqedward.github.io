        <p>In the fall of 2014, Easy Eddy's was conceived as a simple firewood
        business. I would cut fallen trees on people's properties in the
        Rockford and Loves Park area for no charge, then I would split the wood
        by hand with a maul and sell it by the facecord. That was a great year
        for selling firewood in Rockford because the price of natural gas had
        gone up dramatically at the beginning of winter.</p>

        <p class="year-2015">
        <img src="images/machining.jpg" class="machining" />
        Over the next three years, I continued to sell firewood and began
        charging a small fee for tree removals. During this time I was working a
        regular job in machining, but I married my wife Taylor and had a
        continued need for additional income. Cutting trees down became a great
        passion of mine as I gradually accumulated the equipment and experience
        necessary to apply more skilled techniques to the falling process.

        <p class="year-2017-paragraph">
          In 2017 I purchased my first F-150, and began doing full tree removals
          in Rockford and surrounding areas including Cherry Valley, Machesney
          Park, Roscoe, Caledonia, and even Beloit. In the fall of that year I
          finally quit my full time job and struck out with full dedication to
          my own business, which I licensed as Easy Eddy's Trees. I purchased a
          million dollars of liability insurance and continued to provide
          affordable pricing at every quote. Throughout the first warm season in
          2018, my business relied upon landscaping and lawn care to bolster
          sales, but the tree business had captured my heart.

          Keeping the truck and equipment in excellent mechanical repair was a
          high priority for me then as it continues to be today. This focus
          resulted in my developing a superior understanding of truck and engine
          service, and I have made most repairs on my growing fleet with my own
          tools. Paying mechanics to fix my trucks proved to be a waste of
          company money as well as causing loss of earnings due to extended wait
          periods for service. Each successive mechanical failure has resulted
          in personal skill development and the growth of a well supplied
          workshop. I purchased an old F-450 diesel flatbed truck from a
          landscaper near Poplar grove late in 2018, and was able to relieve my
          F-150 from many of its extreme duties.... That was one of the best
          purchases I ever made for Easy Eddy's Trees. The F-150 was not well
          suited for this kind of heavy load carrying, but I continued to use it
          with a custom wooden truck bed that I built myself.

          Within six months from that time, the frame on my half-ton pickup was
          broken in half from overloading, and I purchased a more suitable truck
          for this work, a Ram 3500. In that same period of time, I purchased a
          Bandit 1290 drum-fed brush chipper and hired an employee to drive the
          second truck. I had become engaged in more technical jobs and was
          forming a clearer understanding of safe climbing, rigging, and
          removals. At that time we were moving and loading all wood and limbs
          by hand with no machinery to assist.

          Our need for a dump truck was met by an old Chevy K3500 which was for
          sale by another tree company. Up until we purchased that truck, we
          unloaded every chunk of wood by hand and every bit of wood chips with
          grain shovels. You can imagine the intensity of the labor that was
          done on a daily basis. In 2020, there was a huge boost in the number
          of tree service customers. We continued to develop our skill set and
          make connections in tree care throughout the Rockford region. The big
          block Chevy had a castastrophic drivetrain failure, so I had the dump
          bed and hydraulic system installed onto my flatbed F-450. That fall,
          Easy Eddy's purchased a dump trailer to haul and dump wood. This was a
          great improvement to efficiency and increased our capacity to remove
          large trees.

          Spring of 2021 was the beginning of a new era as I purchased the
          Bobcat MT100 mini track loader! These became very exciting times for
          the business. Now, instead of suffering countless hours of laborious
          lifting, cutting, throwing, and wheelbarrow pushing, we were able to
          let a machine handle the heavy work for us! Large trees have become
          much less of a challenge with the aid of this priceless piece of
          machinery, which fits through a standard 36-inch gate and is rated to
          lift and carry 1000 lbs! I also purchased a stump grinder attachment
          for the Bobcat, sufficient to handle most small and medium stump
          removal jobs.

          There were some serious setbacks in 2021, including the engine failure
          of our Bandit 1290 chipper. I was forced to purchase another chipper,
          which is a much safer Morbark M12R that has hydraulic feed rollers and
          an emergency reverse bar to keep my workers safe during operation. We
          are now able to feed the wood chipper with the Bobcat, which provides
          an additional boost in efficiency for tree removals and trimming.
          Throughout the time that I have been operating as Easy Eddy's Tree
          Service, I have continued to develop and grow as a tree climber. I
          have learned to assess trees for certain diseases or conditions that
          are common to the Northern Illinois region, as well as how to properly
          prune trees for human safety, local codes, aesthetics, overall health,
          and longevity.

          Easy Eddy's Tree Service is equipped to handle jobs that require
          complex rigging and even integration with crane service if it is
          necessary. I gained my certification as an arborist with the
          International Society of Arboriculture this year and am continuing to
          pursue additional education to further my knowledge of tree health,
          rigging methods, industry approved practices, and safety measures.
