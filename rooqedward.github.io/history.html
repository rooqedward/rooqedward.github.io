         <p class="text-right">
            In the fall of 2014, Easy Eddy's was conceived as a simple firewood
            business. I would cut fallen trees on people's properties in the
            Rockford and Loves Park area for no charge, then I would split the
            wood by hand with a maul and sell it by the facecord. That was a
            great year for selling firewood in Rockford because the price of
            natural gas had gone up dramatically at the beginning of winter.

        <p class="text-left">
          
          Over the next three years, I continued to sell firewood and began
          charging a small fee for tree removals. During this time I was working
          a regular job in machining, but I married my wife Taylor and had a
          continued need for additional income. Cutting trees down became a
          great passion of mine as I gradually accumulated the equipment and
          experience necessary to apply more skilled techniques to the falling
          process.

          <p class="text-right">
            In 2017 I purchased my first F-150, and began doing full tree
            removals in Rockford and surrounding areas including Cherry Valley,
            Machesney Park, Roscoe, Caledonia, and even Beloit. In the fall of
            that year I finally quit my full time job and struck out with full
            dedication to my own business, which I licensed as Easy Eddy's
            Trees. I purchased a million dollars of liability insurance and
            continued to provide affordable pricing at every quote. Throughout
            the first warm season in 2018, my business relied upon landscaping
            and lawn care to bolster sales, but the tree business was clearly the path forward.

            I purchased an old F-450 diesel flatbed
            truck from a landscaper near Poplar grove late in 2018, and was able
            to relieve my F-150 from many of its extreme duties.... That was one
            of the best purchases I ever made for Easy Eddy's Trees. The F-150
            was not well suited for this kind of heavy load carrying, but I
            continued to use it with a custom wooden truck bed that I built
            myself.

            Within six months from that time, the frame on my half-ton pickup
            was broken in half from overloading, and I purchased a more suitable
            truck for this work, a Ram 3500. In that same period of time, I
            purchased a Bandit 1290 drum-fed brush chipper and hired an employee
            to drive the second truck. I had become engaged in more technical
            jobs and was forming a clearer understanding of safe climbing,
            rigging, and removals. At that time we were moving and loading all
            wood and limbs by hand with no machinery to assist.

          <p class="text-left">
            Our need for a dump truck was met by an old Chevy K3500 which was
            for sale by another tree company. Up until we purchased that truck,
            we unloaded every chunk of wood by hand and every bit of wood chips
            with grain shovels. You can imagine the intensity of the labor that
            was done on a daily basis. <br> The business grew quickly as we continued to develop our skill
            set and make connections in tree care throughout the Rockford
            region. The big block Chevy had a castastrophic drivetrain failure,
            so I had the dump bed and hydraulic system installed onto my flatbed
            F-450. That fall, Easy Eddy's purchased a dump trailer to haul and
            dump wood. This was a great improvement to efficiency and increased
            our capacity to remove large trees.

            Spring of 2021 was the beginning of a new era as I purchased the
            Bobcat MT100 mini track loader! These became very exciting times for
            the business. Now, instead of suffering countless hours of laborious
            lifting, cutting, throwing, and wheelbarrow pushing, we were able to
            let a machine handle the heavy work for us! Large trees have become
            much less of a challenge with the aid of this priceless piece of
            machinery, which fits through a standard 36-inch gate and is rated
            to lift and carry 1000 lbs! I also purchased a stump grinder
            attachment for the Bobcat, sufficient to handle most small and
            medium stump removal jobs.

            There were some serious setbacks in 2021, including the engine
            failure of our Bandit 1290 chipper. I was forced to purchase another
            chipper, which is a much safer Morbark M12R that has hydraulic feed
            rollers and an emergency reverse bar to keep my workers safe during
            operation. We are now able to feed the wood chipper with the Bobcat,
            which provides an additional boost in efficiency for tree removals
            and trimming. Throughout the time that I have been operating as Easy
            Eddy's Tree Service, I have continued to develop and grow as a tree
            climber. I have learned to assess trees for certain diseases or
            conditions that are common to the Northern Illinois region, as well
            as how to properly prune trees for human safety, local codes,
            aesthetics, overall health, and longevity.
