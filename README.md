Easy Eddy's sample site creation
This is the first upload of my training website on Github.
I named the repository wrong and I just changed the name to rooqedward.github.io
hopefully the site will be up in about ten minutes. 9:47AM

the site came up immediately

images folder had uppercase I which caused ref to fail. struggled to change the name but ended up uploading the file once it was fixed.
